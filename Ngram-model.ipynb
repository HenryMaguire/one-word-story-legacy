air .', u'in this event the shipment of perishable commodities is dependant on space available on the aircraft .', u'the subsequent prices reflect the added cost of the product .', u'on the subject of costs heating a home with propane may be five to seven times the cost of natural gas as in southern homes .', u'food gasoline clothing and appliances are considerably more expensive in the north .',

We could see if this is improved further by using beam search, however, the core problem still remains that the sequences have no memory of their past beyond the previously generated token. This often leads to nonsensical text and it would be impossible for long-term dependencies to be expressed. \n",

For example, choosing a value of N=2, we could build a dictionary whose keys are the two-word combinations which appear together in the text and whose values are sub-dictionaries of all the words which follow the bigrams and their respective probabilities. Then when making predictions on a current sequence, we check to see if there have been already been two words - if so, see if they form a recognised _bigram_ and find out which unigram to choose next. If not, just use the unigram method as before."
